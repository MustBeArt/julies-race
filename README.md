# julies-race
Julie's Race, a C64 BASIC game recovered from 1983(?) floppy disk. I wrote this one afternoon on holiday in Orange, TX for the amusement of my niece Julie. If she could type a single letter correctly, four character-graphic "boats" would race across the screen accompanied by "music". She cheered for the green one.
