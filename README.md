# Julie's Race
Julie's Race, a C64 BASIC game recovered from 1983(?) floppy disk. I wrote this one afternoon on holiday in Orange, TX for the amusement of my niece Julie. If she could type a single letter correctly, four character-graphic "boats" would race across the screen accompanied by "music". She cheered for the green one.

The .prg file is the actual program file, copied straight from the Commodore 1541 disk.

The .txt file is a listing you can type in, generated with _petcat_ from the program file, and annotated manually with line checksums. Use the New Automatic Proofreader from the March 1986 issue of Compute! magazine to check your typing.
